## Introduction
Life efficiency is considered a vital issue to students since they are expected to adapt themselves quickly to new lives in new campuses. To improve life efficiency what we need to do is to know a campus better and faster, a map is a very important tool for doing it. However, current maps, such as Google Maps, still cannot take us to see the inside structure of buildings in most places and maps provided from school are not specific too. For example, there is no specific room details in UEL campus buildings, every time I go to a new room I need to check this room on the sign in the front of that building. This article proposed a solution to create campus maps application allows universities to upload their verified campus maps to show the locations of all rooms and facilities inside buildings. Having these information, students are able to find rooms or facilities much easier.

Another factor that influences studentsâ€™ performance living in campus is attendance systems. Attendance systems are various from proximity card reader to Bluetooth connection, problems exist in different ways. In this case, a new attendance system is put into the proposed map application which is based on QR code scanning. This system effectively increases the cost of cheating and also allows students to check their records anytime.

## Aim and Objectives
The aim of this object is building an application can be used to search facilities and mark attendance records.

- To implement an application on iOS platform and a simple website.
- To build a campus map showing the inside view of buildings.
- To allow students search facilities on the map.
- To add a QR code scanning function in this application.
- To connect application to database.
- To add a function to allow students to see their attendance records.
- To develop this application and the website on Xcode.
- To do a surrey and get feedback from students.
- To write a conclusion.
